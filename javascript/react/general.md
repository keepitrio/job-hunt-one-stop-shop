1. When would you use a Class Component over a Functional Component?
  * If your component has state or a lifecycle method, user a Class component. Otherwise, use a Functional component.
2. What are refs?
  * Used to return a reference to the element, for example, value of an input
  * Useful when we need DOM measurements or to add methods to the components
  * Not so good because... It moves away from the "React" way of thinking.

3. Controlled vs. Uncontrolled components
  * controlled -
    - gets values through props.
    - notifies parent component of changes through callbacks
    - parent handles callback and manages state, then passes new values as props to controlled component
    - AKA "dumb component"
  * uncontrolled -
     - stores its own state internally
     - query DOM using ref to fing current value

4. What are Lifecycle methods?
  * everything that happens from before a component mounts (pre-mounting) to unmounting.
  * componentWillMount: canâ€™t do anything will dom because before render
  * componentdidmount: after component mounts. add event listeners
  * componentWillReceiveprops: gets new props from parent component. You can check which props will change, you can act on new props
  * shouldComponentUpdate: always returns boolean. should i re-render?
  * componentWillUpdate: no access to previous props, but used to take action when shouldcomponentupdate is present.
  * componentDidUpdate: update DOM in response to prop or state changes
  * componentWillUnmount: last min requests before component goes away. clean up leftover debris

5. What are Higher Order Components?
  * Wraps other components and passes data into it

6. Pros and cons of using React?
  * Performant
  * Reusability
